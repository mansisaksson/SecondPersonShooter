# Second Person Shooter
This is an experimental game created with some classmates during university. It was created as a design challenge of making a game in a "second person" perspective. 

It ended up as a huge mess, and wasn't particularly fun to play, but it did improve our understanding of Unreal Engine 4 and Virtual Reality.
